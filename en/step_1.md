There are four essential parts to a webpage that can be used to structure the layout. 

These are:

1. The header `<header>`
2. The main content `<main>`
3. A section of content `<section>`
4. The footer `<footer>`

The **header** typically contains the title for the webpage.

The **main** is where you add all of the main content for your webpage. 

A **section** is used to divide the content of the main part of your webpage into different bits. This is useful because different styling can be applied to each section. 

The **footer** can be used for a fun greeting or for essential information like a contact or link to a feedback form. It is typically very small.
